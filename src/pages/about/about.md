## The reason

I started making tools because there weren't any tutorials, guides, documentation, or anything available for hyper realistic creators to easily make coaster models that can be exported.

So, I learned to use Blender by experimenting with modifiers and piecing together unrelated tutorials to create something that didn't exist.

## The problem

There are many tools for roller coaster creation, but there are too many that lack focus on realism (ie. any roller coaster/amusement park simulation game).

There already is an amazing roller coaster building tool, but it lacks the needed export options, doesn’t natively include the correct support connectors without "hacking" them in, and outdated UX/UI even though it essential to my process (NoLimits 2: Professional Edition).

## The solution

There needs to be a way to create coasters that fit specific manufacturer design systems (aside from the track shaping itself; that's up to the artist) by default rather than enthusiasts manually including these details in our creations.

## The goal

The goal is to create a framework that outputs a roller coaster model that could exist in a real, physical park.

## The mission

My mission is to provide solutions for people to own custom, high quality ride models and export them to wherever they want.
