Blender 4.5.2 geometry node group that build B&M styled supports. This node group is asset ready, and can be linked directly into any `.blend` file. For best results, make sure supports are generated from bézier curves with poly handles.

## New for Update 1.1

- Gizmos
- Improved flanges
- Improved footers
- Improved mounting plates

## Gizmos

With this update, gizmos allow you to more dymanically created supports and adjust them freely! In previous versions, supports were modeled and intended to never be changed. Now, it's possible to both create and adjust suports easily as you build your coaster models.

### Flanges

Up to 5 flanges can now be positioned on supports by sliding the red arrow gizmo on each flange to the desired placement.

This makes it so supports be re-positioned without having to also re-position flanges as well.

### Footers

Each footer is now positioned directly on the last point of the suppoort curve. This greately reduces the need for adjusting the footer's X and Y-positions.

You still *can* manually position the footers, but won't be required to nearly as frequently. To do this, slide the green and red arrow gizmos on the footer. There is also footer rotation&mdash;which is more commonly used&mdash;by rotating the blue circle gizmo on the footer.

### Mounting Plates

In this update, mounting plates are now positioned on the first point of the support curve. This makes placement much more precise and less of a guessing game.

## Get Creative

Not able to create the exact support you need? Try combining them together to create something a bit more unique.

In this example, this support is made up of eight (8) different support curves with their own set of properties.
