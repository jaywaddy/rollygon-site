Built using Blender version 4.2+

This is the original version used in my Poltergeist model which is a bit outdated, but I will worry about updating this tool later.

To use this tool:

- For each section of the support, convert each XML exported support to a Bézier curve with poly handles
- To get the XML exported supports, [follow these instructions here](/posts/import-nl2-spline-to-blender)!

An example of what this tool can output:
