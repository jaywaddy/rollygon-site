Built using Blender version 4.2+

This is the original version used in my Poltergeist model which is a bit outdated, but I will worry about updating this tool later.

To use this tool:

- For each track piece, add a curve modifier containing the track spline
- To get the track spline, [follow these instructions here](/posts/import-nl2-spline-to-blender)!
- Use the Unit Start to move the track piece along the spline

An example of what this tool can output:
