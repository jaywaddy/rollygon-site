## Changes, Changes, Changes

Updated the following:
- Body background
- Pixelated → SVG background patterns
- Contact form UI
- Featured content UI
- ~~Search bar UI~~ (Added the buttons and *some* of the functionality. Still a WIP.)
- Content page layout(s)

Add the following features to site:
- Pagination!! 
- ~~Functionality to the search bar "Filter tags"/toggle button~~ (It works currently, but is currently disabled for your sake!)
- Content navigation bar


I thought I'd kick off the first actual Site Log with a *BANG*! A few changes were made to the UI, functionality, layout, and a lot more this time around!

For this site log, I definitely could have separated these into more bite-sized logs, but I also need to push out these updates quickly so that I can pivot back to working on my models and tools again!

## What's up with the search bar?

Right now, this site is fully static site generated (SSG). This means that when I "hit publish," all the pages and files are generated at that moment. In order to create the search bar&mdash;at least the version that *I* have in mind anyway&mdash;requires the certain pages to be created based on user input, or server side rendered (SSR).

At this time, I haven't really dived into SSR, but I also didn't want to have nothing in the place of where the search bar was in my design. So, for now enjoy my beautifully disabled search bar whose only purpose is to separate my \<H1> and \<H2> tags!

## What's next? 

Well, that's a good question. I would hope the search bar will be implemented, but I'm *really* looking forward to getting back to building tools again!

A month ago, I made some awesome QOL upgrades to my [B&M Support Generator](/tools/bm-support-generator). But, I ended up attempting to refactor some bits without saving and broke the tool. (Whoops!)

As for the site, if it's not the search bar, then it will be mobile design for sure! I definitely started this project off as desktop only (being that I want people to be able to download my tools for Blender, a desktop application), and haven't even designed any mobile elements at all at this time! So, stay tuned for that&mdash;soon I hope.
